# Mastering PHP Design Patterns

Mastering PHP Design Patterns by Packt. It contains all the supporting project
files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions and Navigation

This is the code repository for [Mastering PHP Design Patterns][m-php-dp], published by Packt.
There is no additional code files for the last Chapter (How to Write Better Code) as it covers mostly the best practices with no need of additional code files

## Description

Mastering PHP Design Patterns goes beyond traditional design patterns as envisaged by the Gang of Four and details the practices that passionate PHP developers need to be successful as software engineers or leads on detailed PHP projects. 
This book will introduce you to the core knowledge required to understand project management techniques, why the majority software development projects fail, and why you can make yours a success.
All of the code is organized into folders chapter-wise. The code will look like the following:
```
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
new \IcyApril\ChapterOne\Book();
$pets = array(
    'felix' => new \IcyApril\ChapterOne\Cat(),
    'oscar' => new \IcyApril\ChapterOne\Dog(),
    'snowflake' => new \IcyApril\ChapterOne\Cat()
);
foreach ($pets as $pet) {
    echo $pet->talk(false);
    $pet->walk(1);
}
```
